Keytool Maven Plugin

  This plugin provides the capability to manipulate keys and keystores and acts as a wrapper of the keytool command.

* Goals Overview

  * {{{./clean-mojo.html}keytool:clean}} deletes a generated keystore file.

  * <<Since 1.2>> {{{./changeAlias-mojo.html}keytool:changeAlias}} changes an entry alias into a keystore.

  * <<Since 1.2>> {{{./changeKeyPassword-mojo.html}keytool:changeKeyPassword:}} changes the key password of an entry of a keystore.

  * <<Since 1.2>> {{{./changeStorePassword-mojo.html}keytool:changeStorePassword}} changes the store password of a keystore.

  * <<Since 1.2>> {{{./deleteAlias-mojo.html}keytool:deleteAlias}} deletes an entry alias from a keystore.

  * <<Since 1.2>> {{{./exportCertificate-mojo.html}keytool:exportCertificate}} reads a certificate from a keystore and stores it in a file.

  * <<Since 1.2>> {{{./generateCertificate-mojo.html}keytool:generateCertificate}} generates a certificate from a certificate request from a keystore (<<Note:>> This operation was not implemented by the keytool before jdk 1.7).

  * <<Since 1.2>> {{{./generateCertificateRequest-mojo.html}keytool:generateCertificateRequest}} generates a certificate request.

  * <<Since 1.2>> {{{./generateKeyPair-mojo.html}keytool:generateKeyPair}} generates a key pair.

  * <<Since 1.2>> {{{./generateSecretKey-mojo.html}keytool:generateSecretKey}} generates a secret key.

  * <<Since 1.2>> {{{./importCertificate-mojo.html}keytool:importCertificate}} reads a certificate from a file and stores it in a keystore.

  * <<Since 1.2>> {{{./importKeystore-mojo.html}keytool:importKeystore}} imports all entries of a keystore to another keystore (<<Note:>> This operation was not implemented by the keytool before jdk 1.6).

  * <<Since 1.2>> {{{./list-mojo.html}keytool:list}} lists entries in a keystore.

  * <<Since 1.2>> {{{./printCertificate-mojo.html}keytool:printCertificate}} prints the content of a certificate of a keystore.

  * <<Since 1.2>> {{{./printCertificateRequest-mojo.html}keytool:printCertificateRequest}} prints the content of a certificate request of a keystore. (<<Note:>> This operation was not implemented by the keytool before jdk 1.7).

  * <<Since 1.2>> {{{./printCRLFile-mojo.html}keytool:printCRLFile}} prints the content of a CRL file. (<<Note:>> This operation was not implemented by the keytool before jdk 1.7).

* Keytool compatibility with jdk

  Keytool does not have same operations available for any jdk, see here list of restrictions for older jdk:

  * <<importKeystore>> works only since jdk 1.6

  * <<generateCertificate>> works only since jdk 1.7

  * <<printCertificateRequest>> works only since jdk 1.7

  * <<printCRFile>> works only since jdk 1.7

  Since version 1.3, goals will failed for unsupported operations.

* Deprecated goals

  In version 1.2, a lots of new goals were introduced (MKEYTOOL-19) to perform all possible task available in the
  keytool command.

  <<Note also that new goals are not attached to any phase, so you will have to set explicitly the phase on which attach
  executions of goals.>>

  As the new goals can set all parameters than older one, we prefer to deprecate the old one... Please use the new
  mojo (old one will be at next major release removed).

  * <<Deprecated since 1.2>> {{{./genkey-mojo.html}keytool:genkey}} generates a keystore <<replaced by generateKeyPair>>.

  * <<Deprecated since 1.2>> {{{./export-mojo.html}keytool:export}} reads a certificate from a keystore and stores it in a file <<replaced by exportCertificate>>

  * <<Deprecated since 1.2>> {{{./import-mojo.html}keytool:import}} reads a certificate from a file and stores it in a keystore <<replaced by importCertificate>>.

* Usage

  Instructions on how to use the Keytool Plugin can be found on the {{{./usage.html}usage page}}.
